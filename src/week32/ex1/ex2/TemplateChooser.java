//The TemplateChooser has no attributes. It has the chooseTemplate method that receives a customer and returns the word man,
// woman or privileged depending on the insurance companyâ€™s requirements.

//An insurance company wants to send customized emails to their customers.
// If the name starts with Mr. they want to send the man template. If it starts with Ms. or Mrs.
// they want to send the woman template.
// Also, the Hokopoko family is the owner of the company,
// and if the email would be sent to anyone of that family, they want to send the privileged template.
// If neither of the previous cases are recognized through the name, then they want to use the default template.
